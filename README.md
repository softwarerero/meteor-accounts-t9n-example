This example shows how to use t9n as a Meteor package.

To make the example work locally one could move it outside the directory structure
of the module and do `export METEOR_PACKAGE_DIRS="/path/above/meteor-accounts-t9n"`,
issue `meteor add softwarerero:accounts-t9n` and then run the project with `meteor`.
Local dependencies of Meteor packages are not resolved for a path like  `export METEOR_PACKAGE_DIRS="../../.."`.
